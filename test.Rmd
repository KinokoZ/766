## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

library(readr)
nerve <- read_table("https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/all-of-statistics/=data/nerve.dat", col_names = FALSE)
View(nerve)
```
```{r}

quantiles <- apply(nerve, 2, quantile, probs = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), na.rm = TRUE)

print(quantiles)




```

```{r}
quantiles <- apply(nerve, 2, quantile, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), na.rm = TRUE)

print(quantiles)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
